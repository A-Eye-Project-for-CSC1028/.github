## About The Project

Started by [Aidan Juma](https://github.com/aidanjuma) for the CSC1028 "Computer Science Challenges" module, which is managed (wonderfully!) by [Dr. John Bustard](https://pure.qub.ac.uk/en/persons/john-bustard) at [Queen's University Belfast](https://qub.ac.uk).

This project aims to build a foundation for the generation of synthetic training data for object detection using AI art techniques. By starting with a simple low-poly 3D object as a base and using Stable Diffusion with ControlNet, photorealistic variations of the object can be created to train computer vision models on.

The ultimate goal is to develop a general vision system that progressively learns to recognise and track a wider range of objects.

Upon recommendation from one of their co-founders via email, I took part in the Backdrop Build v3 pre-accelerator programme. A-Eye became one of 43 finalists. On April 28, Build v4 is due to start - applications close a week earlier, to my knowledge. I'd totally recommend applying! You can do so [here](https://backdropbuild.com/v4).

## Acknowledgments

Special thanks to:

- [Dr. John Bustard](https://linkedin.com/in/johndavidbustard) for the opportunity to participate in this module - I have really enjoyed it, and have learnt a lot over the past 3 months or so.
- Rapha from [Backdrop Build](https://backdropbuild.com) for reaching out to me in the first place; Build v3 was a great experience to put my project out on the internet.
